Business Live reader Antony from Manchester is currently in southern Thailand with his wife, but reports they're feeling "On a little bit of a knife's edge at the moment".

The couple are waiting to find out if their flights will be cancelled, following similar restrictions in Dubai.

"Her work and mine have already been in touch via email to inform us of the need to work remotely for two weeks (I'm a software developer and she's a civil servant), but are both able to do so fairly easily," he reports.

He says they've noticed a lot of security check points around the country in the last three weeks as they've toured around, "as well as at every station entrance and exit in Bangkok where hand gel, masks and thermal checks are available".

"Thailand as a whole seem to be handling it well apart from the severe dip in Chinese and Western tourism," he adds.
